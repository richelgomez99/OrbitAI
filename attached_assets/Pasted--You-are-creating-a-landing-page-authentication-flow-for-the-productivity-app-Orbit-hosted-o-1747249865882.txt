> You are creating a landing page + authentication flow for the productivity app Orbit, hosted on a single domain. This page will act as both the app’s front door and entry point for new users. Here’s what to build:




---

Core Objective:
Create a polished landing page that:

Introduces Orbit to new visitors

Lets users register, log in, or continue as guest

Redirects authenticated users to the main app/dashboard



---

Pages to Create:

1. Landing Page (/)

Headline: “Orbit: Momentum-first productivity for nonlinear minds”

Subheadline: “An emotionally intelligent system that adapts to your mood and energy.”

CTAs:

“Sign Up” → /signup

“Log In” → /login

Optional: “Try as Guest” → /app with a temp session


Light animation or visual mood-based preview (basic image carousel is fine)

Responsive layout, mobile-friendly



2. Signup Page (/signup)

Form fields: Name, Email, Password

Submit should create a new user in local DB or auth provider

Redirect to /app after signup



3. Login Page (/login)

Email + password input

Password reset (can be a placeholder)

Redirect to /app on successful login



4. App Router (/app)

Protect this route so only logged-in users or guests can access it

Load Orbit interface from here (can start with placeholder text “Welcome to Orbit”)





---

Tech Notes:

Store auth state using cookies or localStorage

Use Replit DB or Supabase for user accounts (or simple mock DB if faster)

Modularize UI for reuse (header, forms, footer)

All UI must be responsive and mobile-first



---

Design Guidance:

Keep it simple and modern, consistent with Orbit’s dark UI

Use mode colors (purple, teal, blue) as accents

Buttons should be high contrast and tap-friendly

Font choices should match or preview what’s in the app



---

What NOT to do:

Don’t deploy anything yet

Don’t add pricing or plans

Don’t connect to real payment or email providers



---

Next Step:
Once this auth+landing shell is live, you’ll integrate it with the full Orbit app (already under development). This landing page is the entry gate—make it clean, clear, and conversion-friendly.
