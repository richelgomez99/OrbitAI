Complete a fully functional prototype with deep AI integration and thoughtful UI polish. This guide outlines all necessary changes. Implement carefully.

Core Objectives:

1. Improve UI/UX polish for a responsive mobile-first experience.


2. Ensure AI is deeply contextual and responsive to user mode, mood, and intent.


3. Make all core modes and features distinct and usable.


4. Finalize all logic flows, input behavior, and dynamic rendering.


5. Integrate AI using master prompt references and hook properly to OpenAI API.

AI Integration Guide:

Use the provided "AI Prompts for Orbit" document as your master implementation guide. Ensure:

1. All AI features are integrated where relevant:

Smart task suggestions after main task input.

Task reframing via assistant.

Motivational quotes per mode.

Reflection summarization.

Mood-aware interaction.



2. OpenAI API integration is complete:

Use secret key from environment for calls.

Provide fallback UI if no key is detected.

3. Output is structured:

Subtasks = actionable list format.

Chat = markdown-safe, assistant vs user roles.

Reflections = mood + summary.



4. All prompt and parsing logic is modularized in one service (e.g., lib/ai.ts or utils/ai-service.ts).

UI/UX Enhancements to Implement:

Navigation & Flow:

Bottom nav bar remains sticky across all pages.

Improve visual feedback on active nav items (color, glow, or underline).

Enlarge touch targets for better mobile usability.


Add Task Modal:

Fix contrast issues under the task input.

Smart suggestions should be generated after task submission.

Enable adding priority, deadline, and tags per task and subtasks.

Show subtasks with editable fields: due date, priority, tag.

Add visual indicator (e.g., “AI generated”) next to AI suggestions.


Calendar Picker:

Apply dark mode styling for visibility.

Don’t force open—trigger manually with a “Set deadline” button.


Modes:

Build: energized purple, show quote box, fast-action tools.

Recover: teal tone, show breaks/reframe suggestions.

Reflect: deep navy/blue, show past reflections, weekly summary.


Chat View:

Add padding between messages.

Make assistant responses visually distinct.

Scroll smoothly with new messages.

Add floating suggestion buttons (e.g., “Reframe”, “Need help deciding?”).


Dashboard Improvements:

Add data visualizations:

Tasks by mode.

Focus heatmap/calendar.

Mood trends (emoji bar).


Add Friction Tracker:

List snoozed or ignored tasks.

Highlight “blocked” patterns.


Allow AI “reframe” button next to stuck tasks.


Reflect Page:

Timeline view of moods and reflections.

Emoji mood logs over days.

Weekly summary: “Top focus”, “Most blocked”, “Energy trend”.

Behavioral & Functional Enhancements:

Ensure all state (mode, energy, mood) influences task and assistant logic.

Add fallback state if API fails: e.g., “No suggestions available.”

Improve scroll behavior across all views.

Ensure mobile responsiveness: padding, transitions, button tap state.

> Please preserve current functionality, refactor as needed, and ensure all views are complete, responsive, and emotionally adaptive. This version should feel like a finished MVP—intelligent, polished, and distinct. Orbit is not a generic task manager. Build it like it matters.
