> You are building the emotionally intelligent productivity app Orbit. Now refine the app and complete a fully functional prototype with full AI and UI/UX integration. Use this guide to improve and finalize the experience:




---

Core Objectives

1. Deepen AI contextuality: adapt to mode, mood, energy, and past behavior.


2. Improve UI polish, contrast, spacing, and layout (especially on mobile).


3. Ensure clean OpenAI integration using environment variables (not hardcoded).


4. Centralize all AI logic in a modular helper/service for scaling and reuse.


5. Ensure UI components are responsive, accessible, and visually distinct per mode.




---

Prompt Integration

Use the AI Prompts for Orbit document as the master reference. Implement the following AI behaviors and ensure all outputs are:

Hooked into backend via /api routes.

Triggered contextually in Build/Reflect/Recover.

Rendered in a clean structure compatible with the frontend.

Stored or cached per session as needed.


AI areas to complete:

Smart task suggestions (generated after task is added)

Chat (task breakdowns, prioritization, focus nudges)

Mood reflections (summarization, trends)

Motivational insights (mode-specific)

Friction detection + nudges (when stuck)



---

UI/UX Refinements

Bottom Nav

Make sticky across views.

Improve label contrast + font weight.

Highlight active mode (glow or gradient).

Increase touch zone padding.


Add Task Modal

Improve visibility of subtasks/input fields.

Smart suggestions appear after submission.

Inputs for: deadline (calendar), priority, subtasks, project tag.

Replace "+" button with clear “Add Subtask” text link.


Chat View

Visually differentiate AI vs user messages.

Add message padding + spacing.

Make action buttons sticky/floating.

Auto-scroll on new input/output.

Trim bottom whitespace.


Dashboard

Add charts: Tasks by energy, Time spent per mode.

Friction tracker: detect snoozes, stuck tasks, and emotional blocks.

Mood summary: log emojis + short journal entries, trends.


Reflect View

Weekly emotion timeline (emoji + sparkline).

Show past reflections and top AI feedback themes.


Modes

Build: Energetic purple, quote shown, task focus.

Recover: Calming teal, reframes, light prompts.

Reflect: Deep blue/navy, mood logs and summaries.



---

Behavioral Fixes

Use secret API key in env setup only.

Fallback if no key: graceful degradation.

Subtasks must be editable, deletable, and taggable (AI/user).

Contextual chat and task responses based on user state.

> Please preserve your current work and refactor where needed for maintainability. The goal is a mobile-first, emotionally intelligent productivity system with thoughtful UX and deeply integrated AI. Make it clean, flexible, and delightful.
