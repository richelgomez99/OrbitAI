## Phase 0: Research

See [research.md](research.md) for detailed technology decisions and patterns.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

- Data models defined in [data-model.md](data-model.md)
- API contracts in [contracts/](contracts/)
- Test scenarios derived from user stories

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

The tasks will be generated based on:
1. Setup and infrastructure tasks
2. Test-first development (TDD) tasks
3. Implementation tasks for each requirement
4. Integration and validation tasks

**Next Step**: Run tasks command to generate detailed task breakdown.

## Progress Tracking

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete
- [ ] Phase 2: Tasks generation (next)
- [ ] Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Phase 4: Validation
