# Research: Unify database schema and frontend type system to eliminate type mismatches. The Prisma database sch

## Technology Decisions

### Language and Framework
- **Decision**: Python 3.11+ with appropriate frameworks
- **Rationale**: Modern Python features, strong ecosystem
- **Alternatives considered**: Other languages based on requirements

### Architecture Pattern
- **Decision**: Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- **Rationale**: Maintainability and testability
- **Alternatives considered**: Monolithic, microservices

### Data Storage
- **Decision**: Appropriate storage based on data requirements
- **Rationale**: Performance and scalability needs
- **Alternatives considered**: Various database options

### Testing Strategy
- **Decision**: Test-Driven Development with pytest
- **Rationale**: Ensures quality and prevents regressions
- **Alternatives considered**: Other testing frameworks

## Best Practices

1. Follow SOLID principles
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Use type hints for better code clarity
4. Write comprehensive documentation
5. Maintain high test coverage

## Security Considerations

- Input validation on all external data
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Secure data storage and transmission
- Regular security updates

## Performance Optimization

- Efficient algorithms and data structures
- Caching where appropriate
- Async operations for I/O bound tasks
- Resource pooling and connection management
